    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Kitsune Udon is a Japanese noodle soup in dashi broth, topped with seasoned fried tofu (Inari Age), pink-swirled narutomaki fish cake, and scallions. It is the easiest noodle soup to make. Both frozen or dried udon noodles work fine in this recipe.</p>
      
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dashi Broth</li>
        <li>Udon Noodles</li>
        <li>Packaged vs. Homemade Aburaage</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. Before we start: It's really important to have good flavorful dashi for this recipe. Although you can take the shortcut by using dashi powder or dashi packet, I encourage you to make your own dashi because the broth tastes so much better! It only takes less than 30 minutes to make. For vegetarian/vegan, please use Kombu Dashi.</li>
        <h3>To Make Homemade Dashi (Please skip if you already have dashi)</h3>
        <li>Put the kombu and 2 ½ cup water in a measuring cup for at least 30 minutes. If you have time, soak for 3 hours or up to half a day. Kombu’s flavor comes out naturally from soaking in water. If you don’t have time at all, skip soaking.</li>
        <li>Transfer kombu and water to a saucepan. Slowly bring to a boil over medium-low heat.</li>
      </ol>
